# Prakrishta.Cryptography
Encryption and decryption using different algorithms such as RijndaelManaged and AES. The code sample demonstrates the way to do encryption and decryption in dot net core / dot net standard, as these frameworks don't support block size more than 128 but supports different key sizes.
