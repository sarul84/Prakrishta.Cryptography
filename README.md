# Prakrishta.Cryptography
Encryption and decryption using different algorithms such as RijndaelManaged and AES. The code sample demonstrates the way to do encryption and decryption in dot net core / dot net standard, as these frameworks don't support block size more than 128 but supports different key sizes. 

The test project has sample code for different scenarios.

This code samples are open source, feel free to use it in your project or modify as per your requirement
